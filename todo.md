### TODO

Things I'm considering adding before I release this. The list is not in order of preference.

- add ability to add/remove user to list from his profile page
- ~~don't style owner's link in the header~~
- add ability to add/remove user to list directly on the frontpage/news item (+/- or a star icon or something, not sure about this one since it could clutter up the interface)
- add option to select background and font colour for highlighting in the options page
