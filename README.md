## What is it?
A Google Chrome extension made to be used on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). It allows you to add your favourite HN users to a list, and then the extension will highlight those users on every HN page. The extension will also display a small box listing all your favourite users found on the current page.

## How to use it?
Go to [Chrome Web Store extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hleiemhnepoghplnnhkhpnjeiaifnobo) and install extension from there. This way you will automatically get any future updates.
Or you can download the files from here and load it into Chrome by hand (load unpacked extension).

## Why?
